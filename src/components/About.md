# About

Hi, my name is Ian Mungovan. I am a DevSecOps Engineer at Rolls-Royce Defense in Indianapolis Indiana, with a focus on Cloud Native Development, Application Security, and Digital Transformation. I am also a Cyber Security Officer in the US Army. Learn more about my work experience, education, and hobbies below.

## Work Experience

I currently work for Roll-Royce Defense in Indianapolis Indiana as a DevSecOps Engineer as part of the digital transformation team. I support programs such as our new win, as well as our legacy programs around the business. Half my time is spent strategizing with program leaders on how we can digitally transform to be in line with new DOD requirements. The other half of my time is spent implementing these new ideas with teams around the business.

I also work as a CyberSecurity Officer in the Indiana National Guard as part of the 127th Cyber Protection Battalion. And will be attending the US Army Cyber School at Fort Gordon in the fall of 2023.

## Education

I hold a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. I attended the Embry-Riddle on an Army ROTC scholarship, with a concentration in unmanned robotic systems and a minor in military science, graduating in 2020.

At Embry-Riddle I was a part of the Embry-Riddle EcoCar team, working on self-driving capabilities with a focus on computer vision. I have two published papers for SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics). One paper on predicting country of origin for those of Hispanic descent to predict future election outcomes. The other is on optimizing flight patterns for private jets to reduce fuel consumption and operating costs.

I have completed SANS 522: Web Application Security, Virtual Hacking Labs, CompTIA Security+, Udacity Cloud Native Developer, and Udacity Azure Cloud Developer.

## Hobbies

Guitar, Piano, Building Software, Hiking, reading about history, economic theory, and politics, and playing with my dog.

In my free time when I am not building software, I enjoy playing music, traveling, and reading. I play three instruments the saxophone, piano, and guitar, being formally trained in the saxophone. I love to travel having recently completed half of the Camino de Santiago in Spain and have plans to complete the rest of the trail in the future. My favorite topics to read are military history, economic theory, politics, and tech. I recently finished reading Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt, and am currently reading Hackable by Ted Harrington.
