## Software Factory

The Software Factory is the group of people working to build applications from within Rolls-Royce. It is attempting to organize both formal full-time app developers and part-time developers working on small to medium-group-level software. There is a push to not only develop more applications in-house but to have regular people work on them. Ideally, it will foster a large group of people throughout the business working 10-20% of their time on small applications, which will help their groups and Rolls-Royce as a whole.

### Stakeholders

A stakeholder map has been created by Josh Haines to support both the digital transformation team and the Software Factory. This map can be accessed using 2nd level F5 and will highlight the teams that Ian supports in the Software Factory and as part of Project Catalyst, as seen below.

## Catalyst

Catalyst is implementing modern DevSecOps in line with the DOD. Moving forward outside the standard IA & IT Security processes with an accepted risk profile in order to forge a fresh path of continuous compliance with automated testing, in line with the DOD DevSecOps 2.0 Playbook and industry best practices. Catalyst uses GitHub Enterprise to store our source code, a platform used by 65 million developers and more than 3 million organizations. This platform represents the future of source code managers for Microsoft and the most used and capable source code platform which exists today. Catalyst also uses the Azure commercial and government clouds as appropriate as well as on-premise servers if necessary. As well as using compliant pipelines and continuous Authority/Approval to Operate (ATO) models as recommended by the DOD.
